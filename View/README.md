In order to view the XML file by applying an XSL style sheet and a CSS design file in Visual Studio Code, you will have to do the following:
1. Download the Live Server extension.
2. In Visual Studio Code, go to the folder where the XML, XSL and CSS files are located.
3. Run the Live Server extension to simulate a server (the extension will be seen below on the right).
4. The folder with the files will open in the browser with a port that the extension will assign.
5. Open the XML file to view.
